About:

The project is about building a comprehensive solution for Caribbean teachers with a focus on allowing them to evaluate their students via data visualization (bar charts/line charts etc) to improve their efficiency in planning and teaching.

Tools:

As with all of our projects we are stressing online collaboration:

* For collaborative architectural design we are using the free tool available at www.draw.io 

Set up: 	- To set it up you will need a dropbox account
		- The online tool will create a folder called 'app' in which it will 			save all working versions of your diagrams. This folder cannot be 			shared otherwise we would have simply shared tropicode's app folder 			with you	 
		- This means that your diagrams will only be visible to you
		- To allow the rest of the team to access you work/changes youve made 			to already existing diagrams you must save the diagrams in the shared 			dropbox folder 'Software development'
 		-Exact locations will change but for example, class diagram versions 			are stored at Software Development\Projects\
		Emis for us\Development\Architecture\Class diagram development

		- Save stable versions as a .jpg
		- Save working versions as .xml (so that it can be reopened/edited with 		the draw.io tool)


* For collaborative coding we may use either www.github.com or www.cloudforge.com not yet decided (you will be updated but feel free to give input)

* For local development we intend to use (Not yet decided)

- Netbeans IDE 8.0
- Glassfish 4.0
